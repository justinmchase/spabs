# Proposal to Include Spabs

## Abstract
There is a debate between the relative merits of spaces and tabs in software coding languages. 
Many people prefer one over the other for various reasons. This proposal attempts to end this
argument by defining new unicode characters that would combine the perceived benefits of both
characters into one simple solution.

The solution is to introduce two new characters known as Spabs, a portmanteau of Space and Tab.
The two Spab characters are SPAB START and SPAB END. They function identically to a space visually
but give code text editors hints when deleting, navigating and automatically indenting code, rather
than requiring every code editor to store this information in external configuration files.

### 1 Introduction
A code editor supporting Spabs would, when the user executes an indention command, insert a single SPAB START
character, then any number of filling SPACE characters and then a SPAB END character.

Below is a table of different characters injected based on the users configured number of spaces:

Number of Spaces | Characters Inserted
-----------------|--------------------
1                | SPACE
2                | SPAB START, SPAB END
3                | SPAB START, SPACE, SPAB END
4                | SPAB START, SPACE, SPACE, SPAB END
N                | SPAB START, SPACE, ..., SPACE, SPAB END

Visually to a person looking at the code it would appear to have spaces, Spabs would appear as spaces.
However, when Spabs are present and a dedent command is sent, the editor would delete the trailing SPAB START - END span.

If a corresponding SPAB START or SPAB END character cannot be found the characters would be treated as simple space character.

### 4.1 Collation Order


### 5 The UnicodeIECsymbol Font


### 6 Anticipated Objections


### 7 Drawing the Symbols
The proposed characters are not part of any script and the precise form of their
drawing is not critical. As IEEE 1621-2004 says:
In accordance with IEC 80416-3, symbols can be filled, be rotated,
have their lines thickened, or be used on digital displays, as long as
an ordinary user can recognize the symbol correctly.
[4, ¬ß4.3]. There is no need to mirror any of the symbols for right-to-left scripts.

### 7.1 Severability
Of all the characters in Table 6, the most needed is ‚èª. We included the others
in this proposal because they form a logical group. If, however, there is any
objection to inclusion of ‚èΩ, ‚≠ò, ‚èº, or üå≠, the one we most need is ‚èª.
